List of every city in America in Dart as a list of objects, where each object represents a city with its name, state, and country. Each object is created using the City class constructor with the city name, state name, and country name as arguments. The list contains one object for each city in America, and the objects are separated by commas. The format is as follows:

List<City> cities = [
  City(nameCity: 'Dublin', nameState: 'California', nameCountry: 'United States of America'),
  City(nameCity: 'Dublin', nameState: 'Georgia', nameCountry: 'United States of America'),
  City(nameCity: 'Dublin', nameState: 'Ohio', nameCountry: 'United States of America'),
  // ... more cities ...
];

This format makes it easy to access and use the city data in your Dart program, and that it follows a standard naming convention for the properties of each city object.
